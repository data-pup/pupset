# PUPSET: Pup's Stream Editing Tool

Pupset is a toy stream editing tool intended to work as an alternative to `sed`.

### Motivations

This is a toy implementation, building off of the 12th chapter of the 2nd
edition of the Rust book. Rather than implementing a simple copy of `grep`,
this project will involve building a stream editor such as `sed`.

In the interest of learning, as well as pre-existing interest in designing
my own stream editing tool, this project will not be a simple port of `sed` to
Rust. With this project, I would like to build a decent alternative that
emphasizes humanly-readable commands.
